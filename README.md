# SimpleGLTF2
A WIP deserializer / loader for GLTF2 written in Java.
This project provides a basic deserializer to aid in loading of GLTF2 files.

## Repository Layout

The [data](https://github.com/MESLewis/SimpleGLTF2/tree/master/src/main/java/com/meslewis/simplegltf2) package
contains Java classes to hold deserialized GLTF2 JSON.

The [data-only](https://github.com/MESLewis/SimpleGLTF2/tree/data-only/src/main/java/com/meslewis/simplegltf2/data)
branch maintains a bare-bones implementation of `data`, suitable for modification for other projects.
